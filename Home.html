          JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used for web
          development: JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that
          allows interactive and dynamic elements on web pages. It enables
          developers to manipulate webpage content, handle user interactions,
          and create responsive user interfaces. JavaScript can also be used on
          the server-side (Node.js) for building scalable and real-time
          applications. With a wide range of libraries and frameworks available,
          JavaScript remains a fundamental tool in modern web development.
